# My Role
My main role was as a programmer in this project. I was responsible for developing and implementing the attack sequences and enemy projectile mechanics. Specifically. I implemented and optimised the system that allowed enemy projectiles to accurately home into the player. 

# Technology
This game was built in the Unity game engine due to the ease of use to develop a game in a short time frame.
